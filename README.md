- [ ] fix and refactor the engine (using the accumulated experience and feedback) 
- [ ] make consistent API
- [ ] write propper documentation
- [ ] unify installation packages (variants: static zip distribution and docker container)
- [ ] create web administrative interface

NOTE: most of these changes are done on a private branch and will be merged as they are complete.
